# HADES Development Phases

## 1. Development Timeline and Milestones

Below is a general timeline suggesting how HADES might progress from proof-of-concept to production:

1. **Phase 1: Core Architecture & Basic Retrieval (Weeks 1–4)**
   - Set up PostgreSQL (authentication) and ArangoDB (knowledge graph) databases.
   - Implement separate API (FastAPI) and MCP (WebSocket) servers with clear separation of concerns.
   - Create password management and database reset scripts for secure development.
   - Implement a minimal version of PathRAG for basic graph traversal.
   - Establish base security infrastructure with PostgreSQL-based authentication.

2. **Phase 2: Advanced Retrieval & TCR Integration (Weeks 5–8)**
   - Add Triple Context Restoration (TCR) to provide richer context.
   - Implement partial query-driven feedback loops for missing knowledge.
   - Validate multi-hop retrieval performance.
   - Implement differential versioning system for knowledge graph tracking.
   - Enhance data ingestion pipeline with validation and preprocessing.

3. **Phase 3: Fact-Checking & Continual Learning (Weeks 9–12)**
   - Integrate the GraphCheck module to validate LLM outputs post-generation.
   - Add External Continual Learner (ECL) for domain tagging and dynamic updates.
   - Conduct early-stage load testing and optimization.
   - Extend version-awareness to all components for time-travel queries.
   - Implement Role-Based Access Control and enhanced security features.

4. **Phase 4: Finalization & Production Readiness (Weeks 13–16)**
   - Harden security (RBAC, token authentication, API keys, rate limiting, audit logging).
   - Comprehensive integration testing of all components.
   - Optimize performance with caching and query improvements.
   - Deploy to local or on-prem environment with real data ingestion.
   - Implement monitoring and alerting systems.

## 2. Phase-Specific Implementation Details

### Phase 1: Core Setup
- **Goals**: Establish the dual-server architecture and database infrastructure with proper authentication.
- **Key Tasks**:
  - Create separate API (REST/FastAPI) and MCP (WebSocket) server implementations.
  - Set up PostgreSQL for authentication and ArangoDB for knowledge storage.
  - Implement secure password management with rotation capabilities.
  - Create database reset scripts for development and testing.
  - Configure MCP server with initial tool registrations.
  - Set up local environment with Poetry and systemd scripts for process management.
  - Implement basic authentication with PostgreSQL and token generation.
  - Design core classes for the layered architecture.

### Phase 2: Enhanced Retrieval
- **Goals**: Implement TCR to enrich the knowledge graph with contextual sentences and establish version tracking.  
- **Key Tasks**:
  - Integrate ModernBERT-large embeddings for TCR matching.
  - Test retrieval across a variety of domain subsets to ensure alignment with ECL (in preparation for Phase 3).
  - Begin building the partial feedback loop for incomplete or uncertain answers.
  - Implement differential versioning system with semantic versioning.
  - Create data ingestion pipeline with Pydantic models for validation.
  - Add version metadata to all database operations.

### Phase 3: Verification & Continuous Updates
- **Goals**: Make responses factually robust, keep knowledge fresh, and ensure security.  
- **Key Tasks**:
  - Add GraphCheck as a post-generation tool with version-aware verification.
  - Implement ECL for incremental ingestion and processing of version diffs.
  - Begin implementing performance metrics and structured logging for real-world usage.
  - Make all components version-aware to support time-travel queries.
  - Implement Role-Based Access Control with predefined roles and permissions.
  - Add API key management for programmatic access.
  - Enhance error handling and logging throughout the system.

### Phase 4: Production Hardening
- **Goals**: Finalize security, stability, and reliability features for a production release.  
- **Key Tasks**:
  - Thorough testing: unit, integration, system, performance, and load testing.
  - Enhance security with comprehensive audit logging, encryption, and rate limiting.
  - Optimize performance with caching, batch processing, and query improvements.
  - Prepare for real-world data ingestion pipeline and user-facing endpoints.
  - Implement monitoring and alerting systems for production deployment.
  - Create comprehensive documentation for all components and APIs.

## 3. Testing and Validation Framework

1. **Unit Tests**  
   - Validate the correctness of each individual module (e.g., TCR triple extraction, GraphCheck GNN inference).
   - Use pytest or a similar framework with code coverage reporting.
   - Include specific tests for versioning, security, and data validation.

2. **Integration Tests**  
   - Ensure that PathRAG, TCR, GraphCheck, and ECL work seamlessly together.
   - Mock out external dependencies like the LLM or a remote knowledge source, where needed.
   - Test version-aware operations and security integrations.

3. **System Tests**  
   - End-to-end tests where queries travel from the MCP server into the retrieval pipeline and back.
   - Evaluate correctness, latency, concurrency, and reliability.
   - Test different roles and permissions to ensure proper access control.

4. **Performance and Load Testing**  
   - Stress test the system using tools like Locust or JMeter, focusing on high volumes of parallel queries.
   - Benchmark ingestion pipeline performance when ingesting large volumes of data.
   - Test the performance of version-aware queries against historical states.
   - Verify that rate limiting functions correctly under load.

## 4. Deployment Considerations

- **On-Metal Installation**: HADES is well-suited for on-prem installations on powerful servers or workstations with sufficient CPU cores and RAM.
- **Containerization**: Docker or Kubernetes can be used to orchestrate multiple HADES components (e.g., ArangoDB, MCP server, LLM container).
- **DevOps**: 
  - Use systemd for local service management, as described in the base specification.
  - Integrate CI/CD pipelines (GitHub Actions or GitLab CI) for automated testing and deployments.
- **Security Configuration**:
  - Store master encryption keys and salts in secure environment variables.
  - Implement proper key rotation and management procedures.
  - Ensure audit logs are properly stored and analyzed.

## 5. Future Enhancements and Roadmap

1. **GPU Offloading**  
   - While much of the GraphCheck GNN logic can run on CPU, large-scale or highly connected graphs may benefit from GPU acceleration.

2. **Expanded Domain Knowledge**  
   - Incorporate domain-specific expansions by refining ECL embeddings for specialized fields (e.g., legal, medical).

3. **Federated Knowledge Graph**  
   - Connect multiple ArangoDB instances or incorporate other graph databases as "federated" data sources for cross-domain queries.

4. **Explainability and Audit Trails**  
   - Develop an interface that shows the user exactly which path (or chain of facts) was used to arrive at the final answer, enhancing trust and transparency.

5. **Zero-Trust Security Model**  
   - Further harden the RBAC system with Just-In-Time access, enhanced encryption, and attribute-based access controls.
   - Implement security information and event monitoring (SIEM) integration.

6. **Advanced Caching Strategies**
   - Implement multi-level caching for frequent queries against common versions.
   - Add distributed caching for horizontally scaled deployments.

7. **Distributed Processing**
   - Enhance the architecture to support distributed processing of queries and data ingestion.
   - Implement sharding strategies for large-scale knowledge graphs.
