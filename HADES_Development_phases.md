# HADES Development Phases

## 1. Development Timeline and Milestones

Below is a general timeline suggesting how HADES might progress from proof-of-concept to production:

1. **Phase 1: Core Architecture & Basic Retrieval (Weeks 1–4)**
   - Set up ArangoDB and skeleton code for LLM integration.
   - Implement a minimal version of PathRAG for basic graph traversal.
   - Integrate the MCP server with simple tool registrations.

2. **Phase 2: Advanced Retrieval & TCR Integration (Weeks 5–8)**
   - Add Triple Context Restoration (TCR) to provide richer context.
   - Implement partial query-driven feedback loops for missing knowledge.
   - Validate multi-hop retrieval performance.

3. **Phase 3: Fact-Checking & Continual Learning (Weeks 9–12)**
   - Integrate the GraphCheck module to validate LLM outputs post-generation.
   - Add External Continual Learner (ECL) for domain tagging and dynamic updates.
   - Conduct early-stage load testing and optimization.

4. **Phase 4: Finalization & Production Readiness (Weeks 13–16)**
   - Harden security (MCP token authentication, rate limiting).
   - Comprehensive integration testing of all components.
   - Deploy to local or on-prem environment with real data ingestion.

## 2. Phase-Specific Implementation Details

### Phase 1: Core Setup
- **Goals**: Ensure that the LLM can query and retrieve from ArangoDB with minimal overhead.
- **Key Tasks**:
  - Create baseline schema in ArangoDB.
  - Configure MCP server for a single “retrieval” tool.
  - Set up local environment with Poetry and systemd scripts for process management.

### Phase 2: Enhanced Retrieval
- **Goals**: Implement TCR to enrich the knowledge graph with contextual sentences.  
- **Key Tasks**:
  - Integrate ModernBERT-large embeddings for TCR matching.
  - Test retrieval across a variety of domain subsets to ensure alignment with ECL (in preparation for Phase 3).
  - Begin building the partial feedback loop for incomplete or uncertain answers.

### Phase 3: Verification & Continuous Updates
- **Goals**: Make responses factually robust and keep knowledge fresh.  
- **Key Tasks**:
  - Add GraphCheck as a post-generation tool. 
  - Implement ECL for incremental ingestion of new data and domain tagging. 
  - Begin implementing performance metrics and structured logging for real-world usage.

### Phase 4: Production Hardening
- **Goals**: Finalize security, stability, and reliability features for a production release.  
- **Key Tasks**:
  - Thorough testing: unit, integration, system, performance, and load testing.
  - Integrate authentication (token-based) and rate limiting in the MCP server.
  - Prepare for real-world data ingestion pipeline and user-facing endpoints.

## 3. Testing and Validation Framework

1. **Unit Tests**  
   - Validate the correctness of each individual module (e.g., TCR triple extraction, GraphCheck GNN inference).
   - Use pytest or a similar framework with code coverage reporting.

2. **Integration Tests**  
   - Ensure that PathRAG, TCR, GraphCheck, and ECL work seamlessly together.
   - Mock out external dependencies like the LLM or a remote knowledge source, where needed.

3. **System Tests**  
   - End-to-end tests where queries travel from the MCP server into the retrieval pipeline and back.
   - Evaluate correctness, latency, concurrency, and reliability.

4. **Performance and Load Testing**  
   - Stress test the system using tools like Locust or JMeter, focusing on high volumes of parallel queries.
   - Benchmark ingestion pipeline performance when ingesting large volumes of data.

## 4. Deployment Considerations

- **On-Metal Installation**: HADES is well-suited for on-prem installations on powerful servers or workstations with sufficient CPU cores and RAM.
- **Containerization**: Docker or Kubernetes can be used to orchestrate multiple HADES components (e.g., ArangoDB, MCP server, LLM container).
- **DevOps**: 
  - Use systemd for local service management, as described in the base specification.
  - Integrate CI/CD pipelines (GitHub Actions or GitLab CI) for automated testing and deployments.

## 5. Future Enhancements and Roadmap

1. **GPU Offloading**  
   - While much of the GraphCheck GNN logic can run on CPU, large-scale or highly connected graphs may benefit from GPU acceleration.

2. **Expanded Domain Knowledge**  
   - Incorporate domain-specific expansions by refining ECL embeddings for specialized fields (e.g., legal, medical).

3. **Federated Knowledge Graph**  
   - Connect multiple ArangoDB instances or incorporate other graph databases as “federated” data sources for cross-domain queries.

4. **Explainability and Audit Trails**  
   - Develop an interface that shows the user exactly which path (or chain of facts) was used to arrive at the final answer, enhancing trust and transparency.

5. **Zero-Trust Security Model**  
   - Further harden the MCP server with rotating keys, enhanced encryption, and role-based access controls.
