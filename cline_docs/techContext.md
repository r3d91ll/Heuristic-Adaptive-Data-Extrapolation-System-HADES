## Development Setup

1. **Environment Configuration:**
   - Use `conda` or `venv` to create a virtual environment.
   - Install dependencies using Poetry or Rye.

2. **Code Formatting and Linting:**
   - Use Ruff for code formatting, linting, and type checking.
   - Ensure all code adheres to PEP 8 guidelines.

3. **Testing:**
   - Write comprehensive unit tests using `pytest`.
   - Aim for high test coverage (90% or higher).
   - Test both common cases and edge cases.

4. **Documentation:**
   - Use Google style docstrings for all functions, methods, and classes.
   - Include usage examples where helpful.
   - Ensure that all documentation is up-to-date and follows best practices.

5. **Version Control:**
   - Use `git` for version control.
   - Follow a branching strategy (e.g., Git Flow) to manage changes.

6. **Containerization:**
   - Use Docker or Docker Compose to containerize the application.
   - Ensure that all services are properly configured and can be run in isolation.

7. **Deployment:**
   - Use `gunicorn` or `uvicorn` as ASGI servers.
   - Deploy behind a reverse proxy like Nginx or Caddy for production environments.
   - Use systemd or supervisor for process management.

8. **Security:**
   - Implement robust authentication and authorization mechanisms using JWT tokens and RBAC.
   - Record comprehensive audit logs for security monitoring and analysis.

9. **Performance Optimization:**
   - Leverage `async` and `await` for I/O-bound operations to maximize concurrency.
   - Apply caching where appropriate to improve performance.
   - Monitor resource usage and identify bottlenecks using tools like `psutil`.

10. **Database Management:**
    - Use ArangoDB as the vector database.
    - Design efficient database schemas, optimize queries, and use indexes wisely.

## Technical Constraints

1. **Performance:**
   - Ensure that the system can handle large volumes of data and concurrent requests efficiently.
   - Optimize database queries to minimize latency.

2. **Security:**
   - Implement strong authentication and authorization mechanisms.
   - Protect sensitive data using encryption and secure storage solutions.

3. **Scalability:**
   - Design the system to be horizontally scalable, allowing for easy addition of new nodes or services as needed.

4. **Maintainability:**
   - Follow best practices for code organization and documentation.
   - Ensure that all components are modular and can be developed independently.

5. **Compatibility:**
   - Ensure compatibility with various platforms and deployment environments.
   - Use modern libraries and frameworks to leverage the latest advancements in technology.

6. **Data Quality:**
   - Implement robust data validation and preprocessing pipelines.
   - Ensure data quality through rigorous testing and monitoring.

7. **Version Control:**
   - Follow a consistent branching strategy for version control.
   - Maintain clear commit messages and documentation of changes.

8. **Documentation:**
   - Provide comprehensive documentation for all components and processes.
   - Ensure that the documentation is up-to-date and follows best practices.

9. **Testing:**
   - Aim for high test coverage (90% or higher).
   - Test both common cases and edge cases to ensure robustness.

10. **Deployment:**
    - Use containerization and orchestration tools to simplify deployment.
    - Ensure that the system can be easily deployed and managed in production environments.
