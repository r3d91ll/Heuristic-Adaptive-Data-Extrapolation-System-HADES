# Progress

## What Works

1. **Core Components:**
   - **Large Language Model (LLM):** Successfully integrated and configured.
   - **Knowledge Graph Database (ArangoDB):** Set up with efficient graph traversal capabilities.
   - **Direct Database Integration (via MCP):** Implemented to reduce latency and improve debugging transparency.

2. **Retrieval & Enrichment:**
   - **PathRAG:** Functional for graph-based path retrieval with path pruning and scoring mechanisms.
   - **Triple Context Restoration (TCR-QF):** Successfully reconstructs full textual context based on query-driven feedback.
   - **External Continual Learner (ECL):** Maintains and updates domain embeddings effectively.

3. **GraphCheck Fact Verification:**
   - Post-generation step successfully compares extracted claims against the knowledge graph via a GNN.
   - Initiates feedback loops for incorrect or incomplete facts.

4. **Versioning System:**
   - Tracks changes to the knowledge graph with semantic versioning.
   - Supports querying historical states of the knowledge graph.

5. **Data Ingestion Pipeline:**
   - Validates incoming data using Pydantic models.
   - Performs preprocessing and normalization for data quality.
   - Handles batch processing for large data volumes with error handling.

6. **Security Layer:**
   - Implements Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) with predefined roles and permissions.
   - Provides token-based authentication and API key management.
   - Records comprehensive audit logs for security monitoring and analysis.

## What's Left to Build

1. **Unit Tests:**
   - Write comprehensive unit tests for all methods to ensure high test coverage (90% or higher).
   - Test both common cases and edge cases.

2. **Documentation:**
   - Ensure that all documentation is up-to-date and follows best practices.
   - Provide clear, Google-style docstrings for all functions, methods, and classes.
   - Include usage examples where helpful.

3. **Performance Optimization:**
   - Further optimize database queries to minimize latency.
   - Apply caching strategies to improve performance.
   - Monitor resource usage and identify bottlenecks using tools like `psutil`.

4. **Security Enhancements:**
   - Implement additional security measures as needed, such as encryption for sensitive data.
   - Ensure that all components follow best practices for secure development.

5. **Scalability Improvements:**
   - Design the system to be horizontally scalable, allowing for easy addition of new nodes or services as needed.
   - Test scalability under various load conditions to ensure robustness.

6. **Compatibility Testing:**
   - Ensure compatibility with different platforms and deployment environments.
   - Use modern libraries and frameworks to leverage the latest advancements in technology.

7. **Data Quality Assurance:**
   - Implement additional data validation and preprocessing pipelines.
   - Ensure data quality through rigorous testing and monitoring.

8. **Deployment Automation:**
   - Automate deployment processes using containerization and orchestration tools like Docker and Docker Compose.
   - Ensure that the system can be easily deployed and managed in production environments.
