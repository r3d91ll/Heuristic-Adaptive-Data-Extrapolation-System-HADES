# Active Context

## What You're Working On Now

- **Reviewing Remaining Modules:**
  - Ensuring that all modules in the project are correctly implemented and aligned with best practices.
  
- **Creating Additional Memory Bank Files (if needed):**
  - Documenting the system patterns, technologies used, development setup, technical constraints, and progress status.

- **Implement Unit Tests:**
  - Writing comprehensive unit tests for all methods to ensure high test coverage (90% or higher).

- **Review Documentation:**
  - Ensuring that all documentation is up-to-date and follows best practices.

## Recent Changes

1. **Updated `restore_context_for_path`:**
   - Correctly extracts subject and object vertices from each relationship in the path.
   - Fetches full vertex information from the database.

2. **Updated `query_driven_feedback`:**
   - Identifies uncertainty markers in the initial response using multiple phrases.
   - Extracts entities from both the query and response.
   - Searches for additional context based on extracted entities.

3. **Updated `store_new_context`:**
   - Includes input validation, detailed logging, and robust exception handling.

4. **Updated `extract_triples_from_text`:**
   - Uses a more advanced NLP model (`en_core_web_md`) for better entity recognition and relationship extraction.

5. **Corrected Model Name in `src/ecl/learner.py`:**
   - Changed `'bert-base-2cased'` to `'ModernBERT-large'`.

6. **Reviewed `src/cli/version_manager.py`, `src/cli/query.py`, `src/cli/version_visualizer.py`, `src/core/orchestrator.py`, `src/core/data_ingestion.py`, and `src/core/security.py`:**
   - Ensured that all modules are correctly implemented and aligned with best practices.

7. **Reviewed `src/db/connection.py` and `src/mcp/server.py`:**
   - Ensured that the database connection and API endpoints are correctly implemented and aligned with best practices.

8. **Updated `PathRAG` in `src/rag/path_rag.py`:**
   - Implemented path pruning and scoring mechanisms to enhance the retrieval of paths from the knowledge graph.
